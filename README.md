# 2D-Tactics

A basic implementation of a tactics-like game. To get more familiarity with the unity engine, I wanted to implement a single battle as 
seen in various tactics games, such as Final Fantasy: Tactics. The goal is to get a reasonable level of polish on that one level.

## Rough feautre list

_This is based on a brainstorm and may or may not change depending on time, what I feel like and what piece of unity I'm currently interested in._

* Move character on a simple grid
* Highlight character movement range
* Limit movement range
* Switch Turns with CPU
* **very** basic AI to move CPU
* Perform basic attacks
* Perform "special" attacks (just another action with a different animation, maybe different range or effect)
* Show movement effect on enemy of given action
* Item use
* Clean-up presentation:
  * Use actual ground-tile sprites
  * Play with the 2d lightning system
  * Have a start-menu
  * Have a pause menu
* Save state of current combat
